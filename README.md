### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Marcel Tannich, a freelance WordPress developer based in Spain with 15+ years of experience in IT. Since 2018, Iâ€™ve been working full-time with WordPress and currently collaborate with OnTheGoSystems, leading one of their technical support teams.

I enjoy sharing knowledge at WordCamps, contributing to WordPress through code and community projects, and was a co-lead for the Content Team at WordCamp Europe 2023. Passionate about training, I help others grow in their technical roles.
